# Udacity Nanodegree projects

This repository contains the Udacity's nanodegrees' projects completed by me.

* [Deep Learning nanodegree (DLND)](DLND_deep_learning_nanodegree) through _PyTorch Scholarship Challenge_.
  * **Project 1: Flower image classification**
  * **Project 2: Dog breed classification**
  * **Project 3: TV Script generation**
  * **Project 4: Face Generation using DCGAN**
  * **Project 5: Deploying sentiment analysis model on Amazon Sagemaker**
  * **Project 6: Neural Style Transfer**
  
* [Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree (DRLND)](DRLND_deep_reinforcement_learning_nanodegree) through _PyTorch Scholarship Challenge_.
  * **Project 1: Navigation** is about training a RL agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.
  * **Project 2: Continuous Control** is about training a RL double-jointed arm agent so that it can move to target locations.
  * **Project 3: Collaboration and Competition** is about training two RL agents to control tennis rackets to bounce a ball over a net.

* [Data Analyst nanodegree (DAND)](DAND_data_analyst_nanodegree) through _Bertelsmann Scholarship Challenge_.
  * **Project 1: Explore Weather trends** analyzes local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.
  * **Project 2: Investigate a dataset** analyzes a dataset and then communicates the findings.
  * **Project 3: Analyze A/B test results** understands the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.
  * **Project 4: Wrangle and Analyze Data** wrangles and analyzes the tweet data of WeRateDogs that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
  * **Project 5: Communicate Data Findings** deals with data exploration of the flights cancellation and delay dataset mainly using data visualization and present the findings using explanatory visualizations.
